  hi: `I am an aspiring <FullstackDeveloper/> from Berlin. In this intro you will find out more
     about my  programming journey and what projects I was working on in the past few years. `,

  htw: `I am currently finishing my studies in Environmental Computer Science (B.Sc.)
     at the University of Applied Sciences (Hochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft- HTW) in Berlin.`,

  first_programm: `My programming journey started with the programming language C#. I developed my first windows applications in C# as study assignments.
`,
  during_studies: `During my studies I started to work as a web developer, using the classic web development techstack:
 HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, Bootstrap on the front-end,  PHP with Yii framework and MSSQL database on the back-end.`,

  compulsory_internship: `During my compulsory internship I started to design an MSSQL database from scratch for a company in the power supply
     related field. I also implemented a landing page and a cookie banner using PHP, JS, CSS and SASS.`,

  tentamus: `At my current company I was working on creating and improving existing interfaces in Java and Groovy (Java’s dialect).
    I also worked on the deployment of an existing React Native app to a productive server, making the app available for users on android devices.`,

  BA: `Currently I am finishing my bachelor thesis, where I implemented a full-stack React - Node web application for my company’s logistic department. Based on given excel sheets I created database logic and the UI. The Back-End is implemented in Node.js with Express.js library for setting up the server,
    as well as for the REST-APIs implementation. Front-end is implemented in React.js using modern JavaScript with ES6 features.`,

  mobile_apps: `Recently I started to implement mobile apps in React Native (e.g. Spotify, Instagram Clone) , with Expo and React-CLI, using JavaScript and TypeScript. In my demo applications (web and mobile) I started using GraphQL, 
    which is a great alternative to the REST technology, as well  Amazon Web Services (AppSync, Amplify, Cognito). `,

  next_step: `I would like bring my skills to the next level and work in a professional 
        environment using all the modern technologies: JS ES6, TypeScript, React (Native), GraphQL, Node, AWS, Docker , 
        Kubernetes , CI/CD etc.
        I want to learn as much as possible and gain great proficiency in these technologies.`,
